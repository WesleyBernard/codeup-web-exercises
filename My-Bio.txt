Hi!
My name is Wesley, I'm 25 years old. I haven't really done much so I apologize in advance if this seems a little bit dull. 
I grew up in California. Spent most of my time slacking in school and playing video games. When I turned 19 I joined
the military as a linguist and I stayed in the military for 5 years before getting out and goofing off for a
year. After my year of boredom I decided to enroll in this course because I think development is really cool and
it stimulates my brain and here we are
A few fun facts about me:
- I used to compete in video game tournaments (just local ones nothing crazy)
- I know sign language (my parents are deaf)
-I hate chocolate with the fire passion of a thousand suns
